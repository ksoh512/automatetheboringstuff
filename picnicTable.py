# # In this program, we define a printPicnic() method that will take in a dictionary of
# information and use center(), ljust(), and rjust() to display that information in a neatly aligned table-like format.
# #
# # The dictionary that we’ll pass to printPicnic() is picnicItems. In picnicItems,
# we have 4 sandwiches, 12 apples, 4 cups, and 8000 cookies. We want to organize this
# information into two columns, with the name of the item on the left and the quantity on the right.
# #
# # To do this, we decide how wide we want the left and right columns to be. Along with
# our dictionary, we’ll pass these values to printPicnic().
# #
# # printPicnic() takes in a dictionary, a leftWidth for the left column of a table, and
# a rightWidth for the right column. It prints a title, PICNIC ITEMS, centered above the
# table. Then, it loops through the dictionary, printing each key-value pair on a line with
# the key justified left and padded by periods, and the value justified right and padded by spaces.
# #
# # After defining printPicnic(), we define the dictionary picnicItems and call printPicnic()
# twice, passing it different widths for the left and right table columns.
# #
# # When you run this program, the picnic items are displayed twice. The first time the left
# column is 12 characters wide, and the right column is 5 characters wide. The second time
# they are 20 and 6 characters wide, respectively.
