#The tuple data type is almost identical to the list data type,
#except in two ways. First, tuples are typed with parentheses, ( and ), instead of square brackets, [ and
#But the main way that tuples are different from lists is that tuples, like strings, are immutable. Tuples
#cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.
